Hello and Welcome to my version of the SendIt backend.

There are 3 branches:
jsondb => This branch uses a local json db as store
master => This branch uses Postgres as the database, queries were also written using raw postgres queries.
sendit-sequelize => This branch was forked from a the ready-made master. It uses Sequelize ORM(https://sequelize.org/master/index.html) to communicate with the Postgres database.
